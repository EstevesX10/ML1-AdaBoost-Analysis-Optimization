## Project Overview

In recent years, the rise of **Artificial Intelligence** and the widespread use of **Machine Learning** have revolutionized the way we tackle complex real-world challenges. However, due to the **diverse nature of data involved**, choosing the right algorithm is crucial to achieve efficient and effective solutions. Therefore, understanding the **strengths** and **weaknesses** behind different Machine Learning algorithms, and knowing how to **adapt them** to meet specific challenges, can become a fulcral skill to develop.

Furthermore, since the **choice of algorithm** greatly depends on the specific task and data involved, it's clear that there is no **"Master Algorithm"** (No algorithm can solve every problem). For example, while Linear Discriminants effectively delineate boundaries in data that is linearly separable, they struggle to capture relationships in more complex, higher-dimensional spaces.

This Project focuses on the following topic:

> With no Master Algorithm, is it possible to improve a existing Machine Learning Algorithm in characteristics it struggles the most?
</div>

Therefore, after choosing a **Machine Learning Algorithm** and gaining a thorough understanding of its theoretical and empirical aspects, we aim to **refine it**, specifically **targeting its weaknesses** in solving classification problems.

### Dependencies

In order to install the necessary **libraries** to execute this `Project` you can either execute the following command in your `environment's terminal`:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Or use it inside a `jupyter notebook's code cell`:

    !pip install -r requirements.txt

Another approach would be to `Create a New Anaconda Environment` with all the dependencies already installed. To do so, type:

    conda env create -f ML1.yml

### Execution
Since the Project was developed using a `Jupyter Notebook` you will need to type the following **command** in order to inspect it:

    jupyter notebook 

You can even access it via `Jupyter Lab` with:

    jupyter lab

Once the local server starts simply access it and navigate through your `Machine's Directories` until you find the folder where the **Notebook** is being held at.
