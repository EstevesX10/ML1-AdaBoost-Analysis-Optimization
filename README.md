## Project Overview
> ADD PROJECT OVERVIEW

### Dependencies

In order to install the necessary **libraries** to execute this `Project` you can either execute the following command in your `environment's terminal`:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Or use it inside a `jupyter notebook's code cell`:

    !pip install -r requirements.txt

Another approach would be to `Create a New Anaconda Environment` with all the dependencies already installed. To do so, type:

    conda env create -f Connect_4.yml

### Execution
Since the Project was developed using a `Jupyter Notebook` you will need to type the following **command** in order to inspect it:

    jupyter notebook 

You can even access it via `Jupyter Lab` with:

    jupyter lab

Once the local server starts simply access it and navigate through your `Machine's Directories` until you find the folder where the **Notebook** is being held at.
